    <!--This gives a black circle
        SVG is a box with coordinates (pixels from the left, pixels from the top)
        fill: you can set a border color
        stroke: border color
        stroke-width: border width
        stroke-dasharray: length of dash around border of circle, 
        with syntax "<length of dash> <length of space between dashes>". If no length
            of space between dashes is specified, then it's just equal to the length of dash.
        stroke-dashoffset: The location along an SVG path where the dash of a stroke begins. 
            Positive for counterclockwise direction, negative for clockwise direction.
        transform: (Note that the "counting" starts at the right of the circle, whereas we want
            it to start at the top, so we need to rotate the circle.)
            rotate (<degrees to rotate, with positive clockwise direction and negative counterclockwise direction> <x-coord of origin of transform point> <y-coord of origin of transform point>)
